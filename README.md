# Encryption-tools
A set of tools (written in Python) to help with encrypting stuff. They're written mostly in my endeavours to learn more about cybersecurity.

## Types of encryption (so far)
- Base64
- Caesar
- Morse Code
- More to come

## TO DO
- Place all encryption functions under one class. It will be nicer that way.
